Flower heads (grasses/sedges),{non-senesced flower heads},
Flowers or flower buds,{non-senesced floral structures},Can this be a union of {non-dormant reproductive bud presence} and {fresh flower presence}
Open flowers (lilac),{open flower heads},
Full flowering (lilac),{open flower heads},does not work for absence because some flowers open before this phenophase occurs
Open flowers (grasses/sedges),{open flowers},

Open pollen cones (conifers),{open pollen cones},
Pollen cones (conifers),{fresh pollen cones},
Pollen release (flowers),{pollen-releasing flowers},
Pollen release (conifers),{pollen-releasing pollen cones},
End of flowering (lilac/honeysuckle),{senesced flowers},"will be mapped neither present nor absent ,but with percentage from 0 to 5 for the opened flower presence stage"

Breaking leaf buds,{breaking leaf buds},
Breaking leaf buds (lilac/honeysuckle),{breaking leaf buds},
Breaking needle buds (conifers),{breaking leaf buds},
Breaking needle buds (deciduous),{breaking leaf buds},
All leaf buds broken (lilac/honeysuckle),{unfolded true leaves},Does not work for absence because somes leaves are already unfolded before this phenophase occurs
Increasing leaf size,{expanding unfolded true leaves},Does not work for absence directly.  if asserted absent then make a lower percent of zero; if present then lower percent is 51% since it denotes a majority.  We have a conceptual mismatch on this field as recorded counts refer to % of overall leaf size.
